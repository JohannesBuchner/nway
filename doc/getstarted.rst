Getting started
===============

This documentation walks you through the installation and usage. It is best to
try out the examples as you read, because they illustrate how Nway 
works.

Code boxes indicate text about the illustrative examples and their
explanations.

.. container::

   Useful explanation for users on how to prepare files or how to run
   Nway  are found in blue boxes.

   Sometimes there are ``commands`` you can copy-paste.

* start by `installing nway <install>`_. Do not forget to download the example data files so you can follow the tutorial!

* Learn basic to advanced use in the `User guide: Matching catalogs <matching>`_.

* Questions, missing documentation, bugs? Learn how to start `<contributing>`_

* Get different results in different version? Check what changed in the `release history <history>`_.

* Want to use Python API instead of the command line? `API reference <nway>`_

* If you are interested in the rigorous background, head to `mathematical details <math>`_.
