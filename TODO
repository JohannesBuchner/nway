Patches welcome for the following tasks:

* allow elliptical errors for the primary catalogue
  * This would require, instead of one error column, three: sigma, correlation strength and orientation. (questions: is this not done yet? it is just matter of updating the manual)
* Parallelisation:
  * For the hashing: catalogues could be processed in parallel and the hash bins merged at the end.
    * This should be relatively easy to implement if really needed.
    * Since this is only done once, then cached, and scales with O(Nentries) of each catalogue, this step should not be very slow.
  * For the matching: 
    * For matches with large and/or many catalogues, this is typically memory-limited, so parallelisation would not help much.
  * For the grouping:
    * This should be easy to parallelise. Each group has a start and length, and computations are embarrassingly parallel.
  * For other processing:
    * Most computations operaten on the entire arrays. These could benefit from parallelisation in chunks, but usually these steps are not the slowest parts.
* add instructions on how to use NWAY considering and external probability and provide the grid.
